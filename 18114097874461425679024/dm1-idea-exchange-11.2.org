* TODO Study the Traveling Salesperson Problem
   Here, for python fans everywhere, is [[https://github.com/norvig/pytudes/blob/master/ipynb/TSP.ipynb][a \ldquo{}pytude\rdquo]] by Peter Norvig,
   Director of Research for Google.

** TODO Study the gist of it
   Given a list of cities and the distances between them, what tour through all
   the cities that returns to the starting city is the shortest?

*** Simple to State, Hard to Solve

  The simplicity of the statement of the TSP masks its complexity. But its
  complexity must be dealt with, as the TSP is useful in many real world
  applications:
   - Route Optimization
   - Manufacturing
   - Astronomy
   - And more...

*** An Approach
  The brute force approach is both simple and straightforward:

  1. produce every permutation of cities
  2. for each permutation, create a circuit by joining the last node to the first node
  3. calculate each circuit\rsquo{}s distance
  4. return the circuit with the shortest distance

  The problem with this approach is \ldquo{}combinatorial explosion\rdquo --- how quickly
  the number of permutations grows!

** TODO Study the following code
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp :results silent
  (require 'cl)

  (defun permute (lst)
    (if (null lst)
        (list nil)
      (mapcan (lambda (x)
                (mapcar (lambda (y) (cons x y))
                        (permute (remove x lst))))
              lst)))

  (defun TSP-solver (distance-matrix)
     (let* ((num-cities (length distance-matrix))
            (cities (number-sequence 1 num-cities))
            (permutations (permute cities))
            (results (mapcar
                      (lambda (perm)
                        (cons
                         (apply '+ (mapcar (lambda (city)
                                             (dist (nth (1- city) perm)
                                                   (nth (mod city num-cities) perm)
                                                   distance-matrix))
                                           cities))
                         perm))
                      permutations)))
       (assoc (apply 'min (mapcar 'car results)) results)))

  (defun dist (i j d-matrix)
    (elt (elt d-matrix (1- i)) (1- j)))

  (defun build-cities-coords (n width height seed)
     (random seed)
     (loop repeat n collect (cons (random width) (random height))))

   (defun build-distance-matrix (cities-coords)
     (apply 'vector
            (mapcar (lambda (c1)
                      (apply 'vector
                             (mapcar (lambda (c2)
                                       (distance c1 c2))
                                     cities-coords)))
                    cities-coords)))

* TODO Supply and Test
  The only function definition missing from the above code block is =distance=.

  Supply this missing function so that you can evaluate the following block to
  test this =TSP-solver=:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp :results raw
  (setq cities-coords-20 (build-cities-coords 20 900 600 "twentysomething")
        cities-coords (subseq cities-coords-20 0 9) ;; change 9 to a smaller integer (> 3) to save time
        start (float-time)
        results (TSP-solver (build-distance-matrix cities-coords))
        timed-results (cons (- (float-time) start) results))
#+END_SRC

** TODO Heed Hint
  You may find this python code helpful:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :results output
  from math import sqrt

  class City:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
      self.x = x
      self.y = y

  def distance(c1, c2):
    return sqrt((c1.x - c2.x)**2 + (c1.y - c2.y)**2)

  print distance(City(300, 270), City(450, 109))
#+END_SRC
  
  This code, borrowed from Norvig\rsquo{}s pytude, may also come in handy:
#+BEGIN_SRC python :results file
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

  def plot_tour(tour):
      "Plot the cities as circles and the tour as lines between them."
      plot_lines(list(tour) + [tour[0]])

  def plot_lines(points, style='bo-'):
      "Plot lines to connect a series of points."
      plt.plot([p.real for p in points], [p.imag for p in points], style)
      plt.axis('scaled')
      plt.axis('off')

  plot_tour(((6+546j),
   (199+147j),
   (350+65j),
   (737+26j),
   (847+187j),
   (891+465j),
   (554+374j),
   (505+548j)))

  plt.savefig('pyplot-tour.png')
  return 'pyplot-tour.png'
#+END_SRC

** TODO Enjoy a Bonus!
   Graphics are always good for helping us visualize problem results. The bonus
   is found in the interaction between org-mode-enabled elisp code and python
   code!

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp :results value
  (setq winning-tour (cdr results) 
        coords (mapcar (lambda (i)
                         (let ((city (nth (1- i) cities-coords)))
                           (list (car city) (cdr city))))
                        winning-tour))
#+END_SRC

  In the table produced by evaluating the above code block, replace \ldquo{}#+RESULTS\rdquo
  with \ldquo{}#+name: points-to-plot\rdquo so that evaluating the following code block will
  work.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :var pts=points-to-plot :results file
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

  def plot_tour(tour):
      "Plot the cities as circles and the tour as lines between them."
      plot_lines(tour + [tour[0]])

  def plot_lines(points, style='bo-'):
      "Plot lines to connect a series of points."
      plt.plot([p[0] for p in points], [p[1] for p in points], style)

  plot_tour(pts)
  plt.savefig('pyplot-tour.png')
  return 'pyplot-tour.png'
#+END_SRC

** TODO Go above and beyond
  To show you *really understand* this brute-force algorithm, write four new
  functions corresponding to the four steps outlined above, such that the
  following code block will evaluate:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp :results raw
  (setq distance-matrix (build-distance-matrix cities-coords)
        step-1-results (produce-every-permutation-of-cities distance-matrix)
        step-2-results (create-circuit-for-each-permutation step-1-results)
        step-3-results (calculate-circuit-distances step-2-results step-1-results)
        step-4-results (find-circuit-with-shortest-distance step-3-results))
#+END_SRC

  All the code you need is found in the =TSP-solver= function. You only need to
  reorganize it!
* TODO Think and Discuss 
  Think about and discuss what you learned about problem solving from grappling
  with the TSP and relate it to what you have already learned about problem
  solving.

  First post your answer. 

  Then post on two other students' answers.
