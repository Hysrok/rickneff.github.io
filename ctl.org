*** DONE Grade Lucky's Late Work
    CLOSED: [2016-12-19 Mon 08:27]

*** DONE Answer Ryan Walker's email
    CLOSED: [2016-12-19 Mon 10:28]

    I'm sorry that I didn't email sooner. Life really got in the way. I stopped
    going to class because I realized that there was just no way I could get
    caught up. My biggest mistake was not getting help sooner. But I did read
    the textbook and assignments. Through most of the semester I felt lost
    though. I would read the text book, but then when we took quizzes in class I
    felt like they were not entirely about what we read. And I wasn't sure how I
    was supposed to learn lisp when there were no basic explanations, examples,
    or definitions in the book. There was plenty of code, but I would stare at
    it wondering what it all meant. I'm sure there may have been some part of
    the book I missed, but I never felt like I ever had an understanding of
    lisp. And like I said, it really was my fault for not getting help sooner in
    the semester from you or a tutor.

    I hope this explains better my situation. But you are a good teacher and I'm
    sorry I wasn't a good student.

    Ryan,

    I'm sorry this semester didn't go as you had hoped at the beginning. But I
    appreciate the feedback. I'm always trying to improve the course --- when
    you take it again it will be a different course!

    Have a Merry Christmas!

    Brother Neff

    CLOSED: [2016-11-18 Fri 14:54]
    for masters/abc/exs

*** DONE Add counting/probability question
    to abc 7th Quiz.

    What is the probability that a randomly chosen 3-digit number
    unambiguously designates a date (month number plus day number
    paired without punctuation)? E.g., 111 is ambiguous, it could mean
    January 11th (month 1, day 11) or November 1st (month 11, day
    1). Don't count numbers with zeros in the second or third position
    (why not the first position?) as ambiguous, given the rule that
    days are never written with a leading zero. E.g., 101 can only
    mean October 1st, not January 1st. Eliminate from the event space
    any invalid numbers, e.g. 345, as neither 3/45 nor 34/5 is a valid
    date.
