  In subsubsection GHS Roger Penrose is quoted. Discuss this quote, focusing on
  how he relates awareness, understanding and intelligence. Then consider the
  following:

  In Doctrine and Covenants section 93 the Lord defines some words. In
  particular, Doctrine and Covenants 93:24 defines truth as /knowledge
  of things as they are, and as they were, and as they are to come./
  Later, verse 29 equates /intelligence/ with /the light of truth/.
  Even later, in verse 36, appears the familiar saying /The glory of
  God is intelligence, or, in other words, light and truth/.

  From these marvelous revealed words, and /thinking in terms of sets/, we can
  conclude which of the following?

  - [ ] Intelligence is the intersection of light and truth.
  - [ ] Intelligence is the union of light and truth.
  - [ ] Intelligence is a subset of truth, and light is the name of that subset.
  - [ ] Intelligence, light and truth are all synonymous.

  First post your answer, justifying your choice. 

  Then post on two other students' answers, either augmenting their answer 
  or correcting a mistake.
