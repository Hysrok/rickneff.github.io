* TODO Review Set Intersections and Unions
  Let /A/ = =[0 2 4 6 8 10]=,
      /B/ = =[0 1 2 3 4 5 6]=, and
      /C/ = =[4 5 6 7 8 9 10]=.

  Find
  1. \(A \cap B \cap C\)
  2. \(A \cup B \cup C\)
  3. \((A \cup B) \cap C\)
  4. \((A \cap B) \cup C\)
  5. (A \cup (B \cap C))

* TODO Review the Symmetric Difference of Sets
  Find the *symmetric difference* (\(A \oplus B\)) (which, recall, is
  the set containing those elements in either /A/ or /B/, but not in
  both /A/ and /B/ --- i.e., \(A \oplus B = (A - B) \cup (B - A)\)) of
  /A/ = =[1 3 5]= and /B/ = =[1 2 3]=.

* TODO Review the Cartesian Products of Sets
  Let A = [a b c], B = [x y], and C = [0 1]. Find

  1. A \times B \times C
  2. C \times B \times A
  3. C \times A \times B
  4. B \times B \times B

* TODO Review DeMorgan\rsquo{}s Laws
  DeMorgan's laws for sets involve set intersection, set union, and set
  complementation. Find what elisp functions exist to help explore these laws,
  and do some experiments with them.

  Go above and beyond by not just copying a solution using pattern matching a l\agrave
  =pcase= that works on propositional logic formulas (not set operations) (e.g.,
  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35295829/emacs-lisp-demorganify-a-list).

* TODO What Is True?
   This is a tool that allows you to assess yourself on how you did
   with this assignment. Check a box (using , ,) if warranted.

   What is true of my experience in general?
#+name: assertions-in-general
  - [ ] I had fun.
  - [ ] I learned something new.
  - [ ] I achieved something meaningful, or something I can build upon at a later time.

   What is true of my report on what I learned?
#+name: assertions-about-report
  - [ ] I wrote a sufficient number of well-written sentences.
  - [ ] I reported what I thought about while doing the problems.
  - [ ] I reported on any connections I found between these problems and something I already know.
  - [ ] I reported who were and what contribution each of my collaborators made.

   What is true of the \ldquo{}mechanical infelicities\rdquo (misspelled words, grammatical
   errors, punctuation errors) in my report of what I learned?
#+name: assertions-about-MIs
  - [ ] There are fewer than four.
  - [ ] There are fewer than three.
  - [ ] There are fewer than two.
  - [ ] There are none.

#+name: assertions-about-answers
  - [ ] I got the right answer for the question about set intersections and unions.
  - [ ] I got the right answer for the question about the symmetric difference of sets. 
  - [ ] I got the right answer for the question about the Cartesian products of sets.
  - [ ] I did some investigation and simple experiments about DeMorgan\rsquo{}s Laws for sets. 

#+name: assertions-about-aab
  - [ ] I went above and beyond in my answer to the last question about DeMorgan\rsquo{}s Laws for sets.
