* TODO Review Set Intersections and Unions
  Let /A/ = =[0 2 4 6 8 10]=,
      /B/ = =[0 1 2 3 4 5 6]=, and
      /C/ = =[4 5 6 7 8 9 10]=.

  Find
  1. \(A \cap B \cap C\)
  2. \(A \cup B \cup C\)
  3. \((A \cup B) \cap C\)
  4. \((A \cap B) \cup C\)
  5. (A \cup (B \cap C))

* TODO Review the Symmetric Difference of Sets
  Find the *symmetric difference* (\(A \oplus B\)) (which, recall, is
  the set containing those elements in either /A/ or /B/, but not in
  both /A/ and /B/ --- i.e., \(A \oplus B = (A - B) \cup (B - A)\)) of
  /A/ = =[1 3 5]= and /B/ = =[1 2 3]=.

* TODO Review DeMorgan\rsquo{}s Laws
  DeMorgan's laws for sets involve set intersection, set union, and set
  complementation. Find what elisp functions exist to help explore these laws,
  and do some experiments with them.

* TODO Review the Cartesian Products of Sets
  Let A = [a b c], B = [x y], and C = [0 1]. Find

  1. A \times B \times C
  2. C \times B \times A
  3. C \times A \times B
  4. B \times B \times B
