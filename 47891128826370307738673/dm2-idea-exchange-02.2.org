  Please take an opportunity to apply some logical thinking with real-world
  consequences. With the Savior and his teachings in mind, consider the
  following introspection by author David Foster Wallace.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Am I a good person? Deep down, do I even really want to be good person, or do
  I only want to seem like a good person so that people (including myself) will
  approve of me? Is there a difference? How do I ever actually know whether I'm
  deluding myself, morally speaking?

  Is the real point of my life simply to undergo as little pain and as much
  pleasure as possible? My behavior sure seems to indicate that this is what I
  believe, at least a lot of the time. But isn't this kind of a selfish way to
  live? Forget selfish --- isn't it awful lonely?

  But if I decide there's a different, less selfish, less lonely point to my
  life, won't the reason for this decision be my desire to be less lonely,
  meaning to suffer less overall pain? Can the decision to be less selfish ever
  be anything other than a selfish decision?

  Is it possible really to love other people? If I'm lonely and in pain,
  everyone outside me is potential relief --- I need them. But can you really
  love what you need so badly? Isn't a big part of love caring more about what
  the other person needs? How am I supposed to subordinate my own overwhelming
  need to somebody else's needs that I can't even feel directly? And yet if I
  can't do this, I'm doomed to loneliness, which I definitely don't want \dots so
  I'm back at trying to overcome my selfishness for self-interested reasons.

  Is there any way out of this bind?

  Please think about and discuss how to help Brother Wallace out of this logical
  bind. Help him find the *truth*!

  First post your answer with your logical reasoning carefully described. 

  Then post on two other students' answers, either augmenting (improving) their
  answers or suggesting corrections to their logical reasoning.
