* Combinatorial Proofs
** TODO Validate A Committee with Chair and Co-Chair Identity
    Give a *combinatorial argument* that if n is a positive integer then

    \(\sum^n_{k = 0} k^2{n \choose k} = n(n + 1)2^{n - 2}.\)

    Hint: show that both sides count the ways to select a subset of a set of n
    elements together with two not necessarily distinct elements from this subset.
    It will be easier to do so if you express the right-hand side of the identity
    as the equivalent n(n - 1)2^{n - 2} + n2^{n - 1} (after verifying that they are
    indeed equivalent).

** TODO Validate Another Identity
    Using a *combinatorial argument*, argue for the validity of the identity

    \({n \choose r}{r \choose k} = {n \choose k}{n - k \choose r - k}\)

    whenever n, r, and k are nonnegative integers with r \le n and k \le r.

* Basic Probability Theory
** TODO Answer a Probability Question
    A dark room contains two barrels. The first barrel is filled with green
    marbles, the second is filled with a half-and-half mixture of green and blue
    marbles. So there\rsquo{}s a 100% chance of choosing a green marble from the first
    barrel, and a 50% chance of choosing either color in the second barrel. You
    reach into one of the barrels (it\rsquo{}s dark so you don\rsquo{}t know which one) and
    select a marble at random. It\rsquo{}s green. You select another. It\rsquo{}s green too. You
    select a third, a fourth, a fifth, etc. Green each time. What is the *minimum*
    number of marbles you need to select to *exceed* a probability of 99% that you
    are picking them out of the all-green barrel? (Note that there are enough
    marbles so that the answer does not depend on how many marbles are in the
    second barrel.)

    :HINT:
    These are all independent events, so the probability of choosing n green
    marbles in a row from the half-and-half barrel is (1/2)^n. Compute the
    complementary probability --- that of choosing at least one blue marble ---
    to be 1 - (1/2)^n. That probability first exceeds 99% when n equals what? In
    other words, after how many green marbles in a row are you 99+% sure that
    you are picking marbles out of the all-green barrel?

** TODO Answer Another Probability Question
   Take a deep breath. Suppose Shakespeare\rsquo{}s account is accurate and Julius
   Caesar gasped \ldquo{}You too, Brutus\rdquo before breathing his last. What is the
   probability that you just inhaled a molecule that Julius Caesar exhaled in
   his dying breath?

   Assume that after more than two thousand years the exhaled molecules are
   uniformly spread about the world and the vast majority are still free in the
   atmosphere. Assume further that there are 10^{44} molecules of air in the world,
   and that your inhaled quantity and Caesar\rsquo{}s exhaled quantity were each about
   2.2 x 10^{22} molecules.

   :HINT:
   If a number x is small, then (1 - x) is approximately equal to e^{-x}, where e =
   2.718281828 (approximately).

** TODO Answer Yet Another Probability Question
   If students Art, Bill, Cathy, and Diane each speak the truth once in three
   times (independently), and Art affirms that Bill denies that Cathy declares
   that Diane is a liar, what is the probability that Diane was speaking the
   truth?

   You may assume that:

  1. All four students made statements.
  2. Art, Bill, and Cathy each made a statement that either affirmed or denied
       the statement that follows.
  3. A lying affirmation is taken to be a denial and a lying denial is taken to
     be an affirmation.
