* TODO Learn How to Customize a Variable
  Many of you already know (since one way to do it --- just for one Spacemacs
  session --- was explained in the [[file:elisp-mini-primer.org][Elisp Mini Primer]]) how to stop emacs from
  asking you every time you go to evaluate a code block,

  /Evaluate this emacs-lisp code block on your system? (y or n)/

  If you don't already know, read on. First, ponder (perhaps again): Why this
  prompt? Quoting from the elisp mini primer:

  Evaluating numbers or simple numeric expressions is a pretty benign activity,
  but that's not true of evaluating some lisp code, which potentially can do bad
  things. Hence the safeguard confirmation prompt. But that gets tedious after a
  while. You can disable this prompt by setting a special controlling flag
  variable to nil. Specifically:

  SPC SPC customize-variable

  Then at the prompt type "org-confirm-babel-evaluate" (without the quotes), and
  hit Enter to bring up the Customization buffer.

  TAB (10 times) to the button labeled /Toggle/, and click on it or hit Enter to
  press it. The state message will change to say:

  STATE: EDITED, shown value does not take effect until you set or save it.

  Shift-TAB (3 times) back to the /Apply and Save/ button and hit Enter again. 
  That changes the state message to:

  STATE: Saved and set.

  Dismiss the Customization buffer by typing q.

* TODO Think and Write About Decision Making
  It's your choice: preserve the behavior of prompting every time, or customize
  the org-confirm-babel-evaluate variable to never prompt.

  Making decisions is a task all of us must perform many times, every day of our
  lives. What if we could offload that burden?

  Read [[https://firstthreeodds.org/17657741833134731255/total-noise.html][these thoughts]] by David Foster Wallace, and respond with your best
  thinking in a paragraph or two.

  First post your answer. 

  Then post on two other students' answers.
