* TODO Revisit a Question on the 12.1 Reading Quiz

   Recall, that question asked you (or tasked you to):

   Draw the graph (with ASCII graphics) whose nodes are the twelve divisors of
   72, and whose relation is the extension of the predicate:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp :results silent
  (defun p2 (x y)
    (or (= y (* 2 x)) (= y (* 3 x))))
#+END_SRC

  Call this the 72-graph.

  Your next task is to draw the *one* graph that is *structurally the same* as
  the 72-graph using instead of 72, the *one other number* that also has twelve
  divisors that satisfy the p2 predicate in a similar fashion to the 72-graph.

  Hint: It will be easier if you draw the graph with only horizontal or vertical
  edges (i.e., using --- or |), one direction for the y-equals-2-times-x-related
  nodes, and the other direction for the y-equals-3-times-x-related nodes.

* TODO Demonstrate Your Understanding of This Task 

  First post your answer.

  Then post on two other students' answers.
