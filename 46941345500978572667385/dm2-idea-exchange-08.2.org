* TODO Read a Quote About Combinatorics 
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Combinatorics is a branch of mathematics dealing with problems of combining
  objects, or sorting them into categories. It originated in the study of
  probability by Pierre de Fermat, Blaise Pascal, and other 17^{th}-century
  mathematicians, who were inspired not by the beauty of the math but by a very
  practical concern: they wanted to calculate the odds associated with gambling.

  During the 18^{th} and 19^{th} centuries, combinatorics was something of a
  mathematical backwater. Its association with gambling accounted in part for
  its lack of status, but more fundamental forces were also in play.
  Combinatorics deals with discrete entities, like the cards in a deck or socks
  in a drawer. But most of the important problems being investigated by
  mathematicians at that time involved continuous entities, like lines or
  surfaces. Mathematicians developed many general techniques to analyze such
  problems, particularly the methods of calculus.

  They found far fewer general techniques to analyze problems involving discrete
  entities, because discrete objects can have so many different properties and
  can be arranged in so many different ways. Each problem has to be broken down
  into its constituent pieces, from which a useful pattern may or may not
  emerge.

  In the 20^{th} century combinatorics staged a major comeback for one overriding
  reason: the invention of electronic computers. The objects manipulated by
  computers are discrete, not continuous. They are the 1s and 0s of on-off
  switches, not the smooth curves of continuous surfaces. To analyze the
  capabilities of computers, mathematicians had to develop new ways of dealing
  with noncontinuous objects, and that need reinvigorated the field of
  combinatorics.

* TODO Read and Write About Creativity --- The Vary Idea!
  Steve Olson has a lot more to say about the uses of combinatorics, as you may
  recall. [[https://firstthreeodds.org/17657741833134731255/creativity.html][This excerpt]] from the same book that the above quote came from was part
  of your reading assignment for this week.

  Next, please read [[http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr05/cos126/lectures//22.pdf][Princeton COS126 Lecture 22 slides about cryptology]] (at that
  link), and think and write about what kind of creativity Rivest, Shamir and
  Adleman exhibited in their invention of the RSA Cryptosystem.

* TODO Finally, Consider and Comment About a Creative Act
  The in-class demonstration by Brother Neff of a CRT-related feat has one of
  the following explanations (given that he owns the book /Secrets of Mental
  Math/ by Arthur Benjamin):

  - [ ] a verisimilitude of mental calculation of the modulus of the sum of
    three products of one- or two-digit numbers by three different two- or
    three-digit numbers.
  - [ ] a verisimilitude of memorizing associations of triplets of 1 or 2-digit
    numbers --- for example, (4, 2, 6) --- to corresponding numbers between 0
    and 1000 --- e.g., 123.
  - [ ] a verisimilitude of inscrutable arcana.
  - [ ] It depends.

  Which do you think it is?
* TODO What You Know How To Do
  First post your answer. 

  Then post on two other students' answers.
