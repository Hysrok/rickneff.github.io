  With your freshly heightened awareness of the ramifications of bumping your
  head against abstraction ceilings, a look back at some major course topics (as
  touched on in the paper on G\ouml{}del Hashes by Matt Might and two of his students)
  will reveal how strong you have become.

* TODO Discuss What You Learned
  Finish reading the paper you started reading the first week of the semester:
  http://matt.might.net/papers/liang2014godel.pdf

  Discuss three specific things you learned from this paper. Do a little
  research on and include lattices in your discussion.

  First post your response.

  Then post on two other students' responses.
