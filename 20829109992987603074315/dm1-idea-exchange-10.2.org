* TODO Watch a Video About Imposter Syndrome
  Something to be aware of and be wary of, courtesy [[https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/ideology][a talk by Gary Bernhardt]].

* TODO Watch a Video About A Whole New World 
   Consider what Bernhardt says is \ldquo{}[a talk that] announces the most ambitious
   software project [he\rsquo{}s] ever undertaken, then considers why its existence is
   so surprising (and in some cases frustrating) to people\rdquo --- you included?
   Discuss the thoughts triggered by [[https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/a-whole-new-world][another talk by Gary Bernhardt]].

  First post your answer --- which should be a response to both talks.

  Then post on two other students' answers.
