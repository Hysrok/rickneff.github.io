* TODO Discuss The Code Below That Finds A Spanning Tree 
  of a graph, given the nodes, edges, and adjacency-lists of the graph:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp :results silent
  (defun spanning-tree (nodes edges adjacency-lists)
    ;; 1. Start with frontier = (list (first nodes))
    (let ((frontier (list (first nodes)))
          (num-nodes (length nodes))
          (spanning-tree nil)
          node-in-frontier adjacencies destination)
      ;; 2. Pick an edge connected to a node in the frontier
      ;;    that does not create a cycle --- that is, the
      ;;    other (destination) node of the edge is not
      ;;    already in the frontier.
      (while (< (length frontier) num-nodes) ;; more to do
        ;; randomly pick a node in the frontier, and a destination
        ;; randomly chosen from that node's adjacencies
        (setq node-in-frontier (nth (random (length frontier)) frontier)
              adjacencies (cdr (assoc node-in-frontier adjacency-lists))
              destination (nth (random (length adjacencies)) adjacencies))
        ;; 3. Add that destination node to the frontier unless already there
        (unless (member destination frontier)
          (pushnew destination frontier)
          ;; 4. Add the picked edge to the spanning-tree.
          (push (if (< node-in-frontier destination)
                    (cons node-in-frontier destination)
                  (cons destination node-in-frontier))
                spanning-tree)))
      ;; 5. Repeat steps 2-4 until all nodes are in the frontier.
      (sort spanning-tree (lambda (x y) (or (< (car x) (car y)) (< (cdr x) (cdr y)))))))

  First post your answer.

  Then post on two other students' answers.
